# Prism Launcher

This is a guide to installing the modpack for ReplMC Modded with Prism Launcher.

If you've never used Prism before, you'll need to download it from [here](https://prismlauncher.org).

## Downloading the Modpack

To make it quick to join the server, we've created a modpack that you can import into your launcher. This includes all of the required mods as well as performance mods.

You should download the `PrismLauncher.mrpack` file from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ciSTt7VAKdmNNjalJy4xCAKAU2Owup_U?usp=share_link).

## Installing the Modpack

Once you've downloaded the modpack, you'll need to install it. 

1. Inside Prism, press `Add Instance` in the top left corner.

2. Go to the `Import` tab and press `Browse`. Then, select the file you downloaded. You may need to change the file format to `Modrinth pack (*.mrpack)` to be able to select the file.

3. Press `OK` and wait for the pack to install. This may take a while as it will download all of the mods.
4. That's it! You can now launch the pack and join the server.

## Installing Additional Mods

Now, we've not included all of the mods that you might want. The pack does include JEI and Mod Menu, but you may want to add more such as a minimap. This is very simple in Prism.

1. Navigate to your instance settings
