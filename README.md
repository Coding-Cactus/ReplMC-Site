# ReplMC

This is the new ReplMC website built with [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).
This is a heavy work in progress at the moment, but this will be full of guides on how to use mods/plugins and information about the ReplMC servers.

Make sure to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/friendsofreplit) to make suggestions about the server, chat with people and get the latest news.

Contributions are welcome! Please keep commit messages tidy and do one main thing per commit.
